# Requirements Document

## Project Purpose

This template provides a standardized starting point for Python projects with
modern tooling and best practices.

## Functional Requirements

### Development Environment

- Must support Claude Code integration
- Must support VSCode as the primary IDE
- Must use Python 3.12 or higher

### Dependency Management

- Must use `uv` for package management
- Must support both production and development dependencies
- Must provide fast installation and dependency resolution

### Code Quality

- Must enforce consistent code style using Ruff
- Must perform static type checking using ty
- Must run automated checks on commit via pre-commit hooks

### Testing

- Must support unit testing with pytest
- Must support property-based testing with Hypothesis
- Must generate coverage reports
- Must integrate with CI/CD pipelines

### Version Management

- Must use semantic versioning
- Must automate version bumping based on commit messages
- Must follow [Conventional Commits](./conventional-commits.md) specification

### Documentation

- Must maintain documentation in Markdown format
- Must structure documentation to avoid duplication
- Must provide clear references between documents

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

- Tool execution should be fast and not hinder development workflow
- CI/CD pipelines should complete within reasonable time

### Maintainability

- Configuration should be centralized in `pyproject.toml` where possible
- Project structure should be clear and intuitive

### Compatibility

- Must work on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- Must support GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## Constraints

- Claude Code and VSCode are mandatory development tools
- All documentation must be in Markdown format
- Project must follow Python packaging standards

## Future Considerations

- Support for additional testing frameworks
- Integration with documentation generation tools
- Support for containerization
- Performance benchmarking tools
